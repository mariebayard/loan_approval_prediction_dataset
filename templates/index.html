    <h1>Welcome to Loan Prediction</h1>
    <p class="home-p">On this page, you can use different models built with TensorFlow, 
        Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree to predict whether a 
        loan is likely to be approved or not. </p>
    <p class="home-p">
        The models are trained on a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 
        variables such as the number of dependents, education, 
        self-employed status, annual income, loan amount, loan 
        term, credit score, residential assets value, commercial assets 
        value, luxury assets value, and bank asset value. The variable loan 
        status indicates whether the specific loan was approved or not.
    </p> 
    <p class="home-p">
        You can use the models yourself to predict whether a loan would be 
        approved or not based on the information you provide. The answer 
        you receive is entirely based on the data from the Kaggle dataset.
